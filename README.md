# Java-Calculator
This is a calculator application I developed with Java during my Grade 11 Computer Engineering Course.
It uses Java Swing and the java.awt.event Package to build the GUI and handle button presses. 

NOTE: This project was completed in March, 2016. I'm only uploading all the files to Github now.
