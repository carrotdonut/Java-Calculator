# Java-Calculator
This is a calculator application I developed with Java during my Grade 11 Computer Engineering Course.
It uses Java Swing and the java.awt.event Package to build the GUI and handle button presses. 

# Starting the Program:
Start the program with "CalculatorOpen.java", which displays an opening screen for the calculator. 
You can then click through that to open the main calculator application.

# NOTE: This project was completed in March, 2016. I'm just uploading all the files to Github now.
